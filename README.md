# Facebook-Ad-Analysis
#Categorized Ad efficiency by Score <br /><br />
#Ran multi-factor regressions on two sets of data from two different dates <br /><br />
#Generated visualizations of regressions <br /><br />
#Made confidence interval predictions and comparisons of eCom Ad Scores based on Date, AdType, Placement, and user AgeMean. Exported the resulted data to csv. Got the conclusion that the new eCom Ads are more efficient toward younger communities, but less efficient toward older communities. <br /><br />
#Used SQL to generate the average score and success rate based on category, keywords, body, and adtype <br /><br />
